<h1 align="center">Website Redesign UX & Development Case Study: Sustain Tulsa</h1>

## Overview  
Sustain Tulsa is a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting sustainability initiatives in Tulsa. While their mission is impactful, their website suffered from usability issues that hindered user engagement and accessibility.

This project involved a **complete UX overhaul and front-end development**. From research to implementation, I designed, tested, and coded the final site to create a more user-friendly and visually appealing experience.

## Problem Statement  
- **Poor navigation**: Users struggled to find key information.  
- **Lack of clear calls to action (CTAs)**: Engagement pathways were unclear.  
- **Inconsistent design**: UI inconsistencies led to a lack of credibility.  
- **Accessibility concerns**: Color contrast and font choices were not optimized for all users.

## Goals  
- Improve navigation and information architecture.  
- Enhance visual design consistency.  
- Increase user engagement with clear CTAs.  
- Ensure accessibility best practices are met.  
- Implement the redesign in **fully coded form**.  

## Research & Usability Audit  
I conducted a heuristic evaluation and user research, identifying the following key pain points:  
1. **Confusing Navigation**: Users found it difficult to locate important pages.  
2. **Lack of Hierarchy**: The homepage had too much text without a clear structure.  
3. **Ineffective CTAs**: Users were unsure of what actions to take.  
4. **Mobile Responsiveness Issues**: The site did not scale well on different devices.  

## Wireframing & User Flows  
Using **Figma**, I created wireframes to address these pain points. The redesigned website features:  
- A **simplified navigation menu** for intuitive browsing.  
- **Clear CTA buttons** guiding users to donate, volunteer, or learn more.  
- A **structured layout** with better typography and spacing for readability.  
- **Mobile-responsive design** to improve accessibility on all devices.  

## Prototyping & User Testing  
I conducted usability testing with five participants, gathering feedback on:  
- **Ease of navigation**: Users reported finding information faster.  
- **Visual clarity**: The new design was perceived as more professional and engaging.  
- **CTA effectiveness**: Users better understood how to take action.  

### Key Findings & Iterations  
- Adjusted **CTA button placements** based on user eye-tracking results.  
- Increased **font contrast** for better readability.  
- Optimized **mobile layout** based on real-world device testing.  

## Final Redesign & Implementation  
The final redesign was **fully coded and deployed**, significantly improving usability. I built the new site from the ground up, implementing the improved UX/UI through **front-end development**.

## Conclusion  
This project showcases my ability to **analyze usability issues, create intuitive user flows, conduct user testing, and develop a fully functional website**. By applying UX principles and leveraging Figma for prototyping, I transformed Sustain Tulsaâ€™s website into a more effective tool for their mission. Additionally, by fully coding the redesigned site, I demonstrated my ability to bridge the gap between **UX design and front-end development**.
